# Customer-Churn-Predictor-App

## Please check the "customer-churn-predictor.ipynb" file to refer to the project notebook.

## The code for project deployment has been provided in the "web_app.py".

## The project dependencies can be found at the "requirements.txt" file.

## I could not host the web app in a website because of some errors (my web app uses Tensorflow to load the .h5 model, which is probably not supported by Streamlit), however I have provided some screenshots of my web app.
